# Here's a Halloween animation 
## I simply downloaded two SVGs from [FREE SVG](https://freesvg.org/)
And then imported gsap3 via CDN from [GSAP CDNs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/gsap)
## That's IT, Then I got to work finding and indentifying and 3 hours later was able to animate anything on the page including the backfround!
## Pretty darned amazing if you ask me.
